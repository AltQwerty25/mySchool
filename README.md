## mySchool - A program made via a mobile phone and ready to run anywhere
> ```Data.cpp``` program is an engineering example of the original program that I made, you can change the contents of the container and can directly use the program, it's that simple.

## How to use ?
1. Run the program.
1. Select one of the menus.
    1. If there is a menu again, select the menu, if not there is the result. 
    1. if the program asks you to enter input, give your input according to what the program asks for
1. At the end of the program, the program will ask you to continue the program or not, give an answer that is in accordance with what the program is asking to answer

> Run this program anywhere and edit anywhere for your school / university activities.

## Future update list

### The early history of this program :
* Is this program based on original data ?

well yes but no, why do i say that? because I took the names of students and teachers in my real school, I intentionally left the phone number blank, the rest I made in such a way that it worked.
the program I made is more complex than the one I made on github, I just made an example and didn't use a lot of data here, yes you can say what you see is a piece of my original program and not written in English, I still leave my language in program, you'll find it.
this time I will try to create a program repository for public schools, this program is not difficult to make because I will make it into 1 file.
I copied it from my previous project, so if there are any wrong words or syntax please forgive me, because I am trying to translate what I made in the project, I hope you can understand, if you are confused, of course you can ask something about my project, please leave your comments for this project, I'm very happy if someone else can help me find a solution that can make my project simpler.

By the way about my goal of making this project has its own reasons for me, the first time I entered the programming world when I was in 1st grade of high school, at that time the corona pandemic was already there, now I'm in 3rd grade of high school, and I become a class secretary whose job is to record attendance and the absence of students at that time, and I thought that "maybe I better make a simple program to make it easier for me to record all this", because at that time there was a corona pandemic, student attendance was sent via the whatsapp application.

* Then how do you use the program at that time ?

at that time the lesson time was only short, the teacher only gave some materials and assignments at school, 1 week is enough to come to school 2x to give new materials and assignments, the rest of the day we study online at home, in class I use the program, I just need to know the name of the student who was present at that time and entered his attendance number in my program, at first my program only looked like a program for sorting students.
and I'm trying to develop this program not only for students, but for the whole class, starting from student data, teachers, lessons, even homework in the same program.

* Then why only created in the same 1 file ?

At that time I only had a cellphone, so I couldn't make more complex and simple programs.
I think it's better like this, I'm sure everyone can use my source code on all devices without exception, yes they only need a small cellphone, and run my program while at school, maybe not only at school maybe at university too, tell a friend You via whatsapp about what lesson today, who is the teacher, and also what homework is there, it's very helpful, isn't it?
especially if you already want to graduate from your school / university, there will definitely be a lot of homework to do, you can't leave a single assignment, because that's your final assessment in class, for the sake of graduation, I have to try to tell your friends so that you and also your friends can graduate together, it will also be a farewell.
I myself actually kinda forgot how I was at school at that time, but that's the message I can convey, if you are on duty in class and become class president or whatever it is that can have an influence on your friends, try this program, it can make your life easier to record and document all existing data.
I hope you understand what I mean, I wrote this with google translate, forgive me if there are any wrong words, lastly I say thank you very much.
